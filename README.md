microgue: [A monthly game for January 2010](http://foone.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/january-game-done-microgue/)

Although is says "monthly", this game was actually developed in under 24 hours.

* It’s a roguelike, with a lot of almost-features.
* It has random map generation, but no curved corridors.
* It has an inventory system, and one item (which you can’t use but have to collect anyway)
* It has gold, but no shops.

And so on. Still, it’s playable, and as annoying as all roguelikes.
